##About me
Now I'm working as a Development Manager for **3 years**. My main responsibilities include:
- Technical execution of Document management development activities, lead and supervise the implementation of projects related to document management - local and Baltic projects.
- Coordinate internal Document Management system developments. Identify business needs, collect input and compile business cases for DM system improvements from internal stakeholders. Participate in quality assurance and testing.
- Coordinate e-signing desktop application updates, execute tests, and ensure support for employees about e-signing and e-signature signing tools.

Currently I’m learning and developing my competencies in IT field so I would be able in nearest future change my field of work.
Last year I participated in Riga Tech Girls organized training * *Discover Tech* * and also University of Latvia * *Introduction to software testing QT1* *. This was an amazing opportunity to have a basic level view in compiled way of different IT fields. Now the only thing what is left – to understand in which direction to go and develop myself in it to become an amazing employee and do the job which brings joy.

On my free time I like to go for a walk. And as a hobby I'm going to [Latvian motocross championship](https://www.lamsf.lv/) ***as a photographer***.
